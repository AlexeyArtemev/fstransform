From 0.9.1 to 0.9.2, Massimiliano Ghilardi 2012-03-08:

  all:
    * added explicit copyright statement to all source files

  fsmove:
    * added program description to '--help' output

  fsremap:
    * added check that last device block to be written is actually writeable.
      Reason: at least on Linux, if a filesystems is smaller than its
      containing device, it often limits to its own length the writable blocks
      in the device.
    * added program description to '--help' output

  fstransform:
    * renamed 'fstransform.sh' to 'fstransform'
    * added check that source and target file systems are among the
      tested ones: minix ext2 ext3 ext4 reiserfs jfs xfs
    * added options '--help' and '--force-untested-file-systems'

From 0.9.0 to 0.9.1, Massimiliano Ghilardi 2012-02-13:

  fsremap:
    * fixed build errors on some Linux flavors (typically rpm-based ones)
    * fixed internal error on 32-bit platforms while remapping devices > 4GB

  fstransform:
    * option '--show-time' is now enabled by default,
      use '--show-time=no' to disable

From 0.3.7 to 0.9.0, Massimiliano Ghilardi 2012-02-06:

  all:
    * replaced Eclipse-generated makefiles with automake+autoconf ones.
      new 'configure' script also autodetects required C functions,
      headers and types
    
    * added warning to README about transforming to 'xfs'
      a device more than 90% full

  fsmove:
    * added progress report and estimated time left

  fsremap:
    * zero-file is now optional. if not specified, fsremap performs
      an irreversible remapping
  
  fstransform:
    * added option '--show-time' to print time-of-day before each message
    * added option '--irreversible' to skip creating zero-file
    
  fstransform and fsremap:
    * added option '--no-questions' to run automatically without asking
      any confirmation.

    * added safety checks for devices with odd-sized last block:
      now fstransform creates a loop-file with length = device size
      _rounded_down_ to file-system block size,
      and fsremap refuses to run if loop-file length exceeds device size
      _rounded_down_ to file-system block size
    
From 0.3.6 to 0.3.7, Massimiliano Ghilardi 2012-01-21:

  fsremap:
    * fixed a bug in the routine to show progress percentage.
      This bug cause fsremap to crash while remapping the device,
      leaving your data UNUSABLE.
      
      For this reason, PLEASE DO NOT USE FSTRANSFORM VERSION 0.3.6

From 0.2.8 to 0.3.6, Massimiliano Ghilardi 2012-01-21:

  fsremap:
    * improved the routine to show progress percentage

      This routine was found to be bugged and crash while remapping
      the device, leaving your data UNUSABLE.
      
      For this reason, PLEASE DO NOT USE FSTRANSFORM VERSION 0.3.6
      
    * added check and workaround for device lengths not multiples of block size
    * added check and workaround for incomplete information sometimes returned
      by ioctl(FS_IOC_FIEMAP)

  fsmove:
    * added periodic checks for enough free space in both the source
      and target file-systems
    
  fstransform:
    * added script 'fstransform.sh', it executes automatically
      all the steps needed to perform a full file-system transformation
