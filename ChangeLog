From 0.3.7 to 0.9.0:

  all:
    * replaced Eclipse-generated makefiles with automake+autoconf ones.
      new 'configure' script also autodetects required C functions,
      headers and types
    
    * added warning to README about transforming to 'xfs'
      a device more than 90% full

  fsmove:
    * added progress report

  fsremap:
    * zero-file is now optional. if not specified, fsremap performs
      an irreversible remapping
  
  fstransform:
    * added option '--show-time' to print time-of-day before each message
    * added option '--irreversible' to skip creating zero-file
    
  fstransform and fsremap:
    * added option '--no-questions' to run automatically without asking
      any confirmation.

    * added safety checks for devices with odd-sized last block:
      now fstransform creates a loop-file with length = device size
      _rounded_down_ to file-system block size,
      and fsremap refuses to run if loop-file length exceeds device size
      _rounded_down_ to file-system block size
